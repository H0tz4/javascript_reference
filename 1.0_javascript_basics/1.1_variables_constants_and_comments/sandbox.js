// Messing with variables:
let age = 17;
let year = 2020;
console.log(age, year);

age = 30;
console.log(age);

// You can't change constants.
const points = 100;
// points = 50;
console.log(points);

// The old way.
var score = 75
console.log(score);

// OBS: Variables in javascript can only contain letters, numbers, underscores and dollar sighs.
// but they can't start with a number.
